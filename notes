Difficulty:
  "avrdude" from "apt-get install" did not work on 18.04.  I needed to install from source (version 7.0)
  still sometimes have mystery can't program problems with avrdude..
  I gave up: using atmel ICE instead.. it connects to STK500 board...

  if the name you use in the ISR() does not exist, there is no warning- code will not be generated.  Instead
  vector will be left as default, which is to jump to reset handler.

  To get a starting point for the linker script: supply -Wl,--verbose to gcc

New ATmega32: fuses select oscillator source, default is 1 MHz internal oscillator

 But we need to set lfuse from 0xE1 to 0xE0 to use STK500 supplied clock, which is 3686400 ("3.68 MHz" from the documentation), which 
 is an integer multiple of 115200

save = SREG    Save flags
_CLI()         Disable interrupts

SREG = save    Restore flags

MCUCSR   holds reset reason

i = PINB   read port B inputs

DDRB = 1     Enable output bit 0
  PORTB = 1   Set output bit 0 to 1
  PORTB = 0   Set output bit 0 to 0
BBRB = 0     Enable input bit 0
  PORTB = 0   Bit 0 is high-Z
  PORTB = 1   Bit 0 has pull-up

Default fuse values:
  hfuse 0x99
  lfuse 0xE1

What we want:
  hfuse -> 0x99
  lfuse -> 0xe0 (use external clock input)
